                                <p>Since ancient times, it has been said that only a Shiba Inu with bones is rightful to
                                    be leader of the village. But there was no Shiba Inu that actually spot the bone. As
                                    such, the story seemed to become a legend and slowly be forgotten from everyone as a
                                    rumor, but it was said that bones were actually found deep in the ground.
                                </p>

                                <p>In Shiba Inu Village, there has long been ‘Bone’, the guardian of peace. Because no
                                    one had to protect the village, Shiba Inus were able to leave the village
                                    comfortably to be independent, and they could have a variety of occupations. During
                                    peaceful times, unfortunate news broke out. The Bone was stolen! There was no big
                                    clue in the empty village, so the investigation fell into a mystery, and the village
                                    was left in chaos. At that time, there followed a testimony from the first witness
                                    that there was leftover food crumb at the scene. The food crumb, which had different
                                    shapes for different occupations, was the only clue to find the criminal. Will the
                                    holders be able to find the culprit who took away the guardian of peace in Shiba Inu
                                    Village? <br> <br>
